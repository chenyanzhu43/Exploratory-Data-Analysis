### [Project Description](https://github.com/chenyanzhu43/proj1/blob/master/doc)

This is the first and only individual (as opposed to team) this semester.

Term: Fall 2019

+ Project title: 'A song lyrics analysis'

+ This project is conducted by Yanzhu Chen

+ Project summary: This report is a song lyrics analysis on word performance. I process the raw textual data 'lyrics.csv' saved in data file by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and creating a tidy version of text 'processed_lyrics.csv' saved in output file. When hear a song, the melody is always the first impression we have on it. For different genres of songs, the melodies seem to be quite distinct. While I'm curious about words variability of lyrics. Is the lyrics as changebale as melody, or on the opposite, immutable at core significant level?  I try to answer this question in general and in timeline from the given collection of song lyrics.
